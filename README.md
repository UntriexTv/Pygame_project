# Pygame_project (developing is paused and will be restored in unknown time)
This project is in really early states of development

# What is this project about?
I always liked games where i was able to make any changes and can easily see what is happening. Thats why i decided to make this project.
The aim of this project is to make open source, easy to modify and use game. It will be 2D platformer game.
bassic functions will be:
- monitoring all kind of variables in game
- easy to use mod system
- customization practicly in everything

# Plans for the future
- Adding menu (kinda done)
- Adding more settings
- making infinity generated word
- adding animations
- AI and enemy
- Guns
- updates over internet
- sounds
- powerfull debug tool (tool to monitor and change lot of variables)

# Some aditional info
Soon will be available documentation to this game.
I am not really good in english so please forgive me my english. Also i am begginer in programing so this code will not be really optimised in first releases.
If you like to help me with the project you can do several things:
- testing game and writing issues on this github page
- contacting me and helping me with this project (contact me on untriex.programming@gmail.com)
- writing ideas to optimise code
- writing new ideas to the game.
