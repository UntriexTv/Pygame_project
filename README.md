# Pygame_project
This project is in really early states of development

# What is this project about?
I always liked games where i was able to make any changes and can easyly see what is happening. Thats why i decided to make this project.
The aim of this project is to make open source, easy to modify and use game. It will be 2D platformer game.

# Plans for the future
- Adding menu
- Adding more settings
- making infinity generated word
- adding animations
- AI and enemy
- Guns

# Some aditional info
Soon will be available documentation to this game.
I am not really good in english so please forgive me my english. Also i am begginer in programing so this code will not be really optimised in first releases.
